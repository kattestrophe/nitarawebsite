I learned that throwing used batteries into the trash can be bad for the earth, and is illegal in CA.

> Batteries are considered hazardous because of the metals and/or other toxic or corrosive materials they contain. Batteries are potentially a valuable source of recyclable metal.

>Batteries are considered hazardous waste in California when they are discarded. This includes AAA, AA, C, D, button cell, 9-volt, and all other batteries, both rechargeable and single-use. All batteries must be recycled or taken to a household hazardous waste disposal facility, a universal waste handler (e.g., storage facility or broker), or an authorized recycling facility.

To help in my little way, if you live in the [Meadowbrook Village](https://goo.gl/maps/WzkbR3i1MTGq9AbA6) community,
**my dad and I can come pick up any battery waste you have** and we will make a
weekly run to the recycling center.

You can schedule a pickup by filling out a simple form:

We hope that having something like this handy will encourage community members
to recycle instead of tossing the dead battery from the remote into the trash!

**Note:** We can only pickup every Saturday because of our schedules :(

come and pick up batteries.
