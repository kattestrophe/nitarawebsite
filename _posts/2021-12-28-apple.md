This year my parents taught me about the stock market. They helped me use my piggy bank money to buy $20 worth of Apple stock. I was watching the price go up and down for an entire year, but as of writing this it has grown to $28.63, which my parents say is very fortunate for me. When we got a note in the mail about a donation drive, I decided to share $5 out of my $8 profit with the [Eagle Ridge Hospital Foundation](https://erhf.ca/current-priorities/medical-imaging-capital-campaign/). Eagle Ridge is a local hospital trying to raise funds for new X-Ray machines so they can help patients quicker.

I chose to donate to this cause because I am very thankful for hospitals. Especially in these pandemic times, I am amazed by how much hospitals and hospital workers are doing. I have told my parents that someday I would like to work as a doctor in a hospital.

My parents also chipped in with me and we hope our little gift will be helpful!
