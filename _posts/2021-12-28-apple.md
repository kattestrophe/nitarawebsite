This year my parents taught me about the stock market. They helped me use my piggy bank money to buy $20 worth of Apple stock. I was watching the price go up and down for an entire year, but as of writing this it has grown to $28.63, which my parents say is very fortunate for me. They have asked if I would share some of this for a good cause and I have decided to share $5 out of my $8 profit with the [Eagle Ridge Hospital Foundation](https://erhf.ca/current-priorities/medical-imaging-capital-campaign/). Eagle Ridge is a local hospital trying to raise funds for new X-Ray machines to help patients quicker.

I chose a hospital out of my options because I feel they play such an important role. Especially in these pandemic times, I am amazed by how much hospitals and hospital workers do. I have told my parents that someday I would like to work as a doctor in a hospital.

My parents also chipped in with me and we hope this little gift will be helpful!
